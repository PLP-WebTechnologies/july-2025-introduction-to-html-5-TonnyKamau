        <h3>My Latest Adventure</h3>
        <p>
          Last weekend, I went on an amazing hike and saw the most beautiful
          sunset! I took lots of photos and even sketched the view. It inspired
          me to learn more about web design so I can share these moments online.

        <h3>Why I Love HTML5</h3>
        <p>
          HTML5 is like building with LEGO blocks! Each tag has a special
          purpose, and when you put them together, you create something amazing.
          The semantic tags make everything so organized and meaningful.
